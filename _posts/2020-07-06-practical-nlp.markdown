Being specialized in domains like computer vision and natural language  processing is no longer a luxury but a necessity that is expected of any data scientist in todayâ€™s fast-paced world! Natural Language Processing is a subfield of "Artificial Intelligence"  that gives machine the ability to understand natural languages like speech and text. With huge linguistic datasets and faster compute a lot of rapid advances are taking place. If you are overwhelmed with the fast-paced development in NLP, we got you covered. 

If you want to embark on the journey of learning NLP, we conducted a session on 5th July, 2020 just for you. In this session, **Dipanjan Sarkar** talked about various "**Practical Natural Language Processing**" aspects. 

Dipanjan (DJ) Sarkar is a Data Science Lead at Applied Materials,  leading advanced analytics efforts around computer vision, natural  language processing and deep learning. He is also a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts) in Machine Learning. You can learn more about DJ [here]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/dipanzan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dipanzan.)).

### Session Overview

The session started with a quick introduction to NLP covering the why and the what of NLP. This covered the motivation behind NLP and the key concepts in order to learn NLP. He then covered some of the popular use cases of NLP and showcased an industry accepted NLP workflow which can be applied to any subfield of AI. Finally he went through some of his "essential" Jupyter notebooks and gave a run down of few NLP applications. Here's the quick outline of the session:

- Introduction
- What is Natural Language
- What is NLP?
- Why NLP?
- NLP Applications
- Standard NLP Workflow
- Hands-on Examples with Code
- Text Classification
- Content Recommenders (Text Similarity)
- Industry Case Studies
