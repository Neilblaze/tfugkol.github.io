Hey there!

Thanks for taking out time to dive into the what and who about this user group here.

TensorFlow, an open-source offering by Google, is the most popular machine learning library among developers in the industry to integrate the power of artificial intelligence into applications and businesses.

With a goal of making machine learning and related concepts easier to dive into, we came up with TensorFlow User Group Kolkata, a professional community bringing together machine learning practitioners of the city to discuss, network and collaborate how they use TensorFlow for their development needs.
