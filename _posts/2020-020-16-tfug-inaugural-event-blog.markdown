# TFUG Inaugural Event on 15th Feb

TensorFlow User Group Kolkata(TFUG Kol) is a professional community bringing together machine learning practitioners of the city to discuss, network and collaborate how they use TensorFlow for their development needs. It is a local community of the people, by the people, and for everyone who is a developer, researcher, user, teacher or writer,  interested in Machine Learning. With this as our primary mission, we hosted our inaugural event **'from tfug import Kolkata'** on 15th February 2020 at Moot Court, Sister Nivedita University. For this event, we had two sessions. Here’s the meetup link: http://bit.ly/importtfug.

In the first session which was titled **'def tfug_kol()**', Sayak Paul, TFUG Kolkata Lead, GDE - Machine Learning, Deep Learning Associate at PyImageSearch, introduced the audience with TFUG and it’s core team members. Kolkata is not short on technical communities and thus he emphasized on “Why another group?”. He said that “Machine Learning can be intimidating. Thus having a community that breathes machine learning can be helpful.” 

TFUG is to bring together like-minded people specific towards machine learning and help the community stay up to date on Google’s product areas on machine learning. He gave an insight into various TensorFlow product areas and why it’s an elephant in the room. He did mention that “although this group is dedicated towards machine learning with TensorFlow, we don’t discourage discussions on other open-source frameworks for doing machine learning.

The second session was titled **'Self-attention and BERT using TensorFlow 2.0'**. Our speaker, Souradip Chakraborty, Statistical Analyst at WalmartLabs, GDE- Machine Learning walked the audience through the evolution of the numerical representation of texts for natural language processing tasks. He covered things like bag of words, continuous bag of words, word embeddings through a sentiment analysis case study. 

In the second half of his talk, Souradip took a brief stab at the mighty attention mechanism, why it makes so much sense and jumped towards self-attention. He concluded with brief pointers about Transformer-based networks, BERT, and a short code walkthrough to demonstrate the power of BERT in language modeling tasks.

The event started around 12.30 PM and was wrapped up by 4.00 PM. Domino's pizza and Coca Cola was handed out as lunch to over 150 attendees who showed great enthusiasm during the sessions. The local volunteers(students and staff) from the college helped us make this event a memorable one.
